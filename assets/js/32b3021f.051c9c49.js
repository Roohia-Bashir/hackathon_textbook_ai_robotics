My work emphasizes translating complex AI ideas into real-world robotic systems that learners can understand and apply.\\n\\nMy expertise covers multiple areas, including:\\n\\n* Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning\\n* Robotics frameworks, with a strong focus on ROS 2\\n* Simulation platforms such as Gazebo and NVIDIA Isaac\\n* Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems\\n* Educational technology and curriculum development\\n\\n## Motivation for Creating the AI-Native Textbook\\n\\nThe motivation behind the AI-Native Textbook for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics came from observing a major gap in existing robotics education. Many traditional programs do not sufficiently integrate modern AI techniques with physical robotic systems, particularly for humanoid robotics.\\n\\nThis textbook was created to:\\n\\n* Offer a structured 13-week curriculum covering both foundational and advanced robotics topics\\n* Integrate state-of-the-art AI models with real and simulated robotic platforms\\n* Make complex robotics concepts accessible to students, developers, and educators\\n* Cover the full robotics pipeline, from sensing and perception to planning and autonomy\\n* Use industry-standard tools and workflows commonly adopted in professional environments\\n\\nThe overarching goal is to democratize access to high-quality robotics education and help learners prepare for the future of AI-powered physical systems.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Technologies Used in This Project\\n\\nThe AI-Native Textbook is built using a modern and carefully selected technology stack:\\n\\n* **ROS 2 (Robot Operating System)**: The primary middleware for robot communication, control, and navigation\\n* **Docusaurus**: The documentation framework used to deliver structured and readable technical content\\n* **Node.js**: Supporting the build pipeline and static site generation\\n* **Gazebo**: Physics-based simulation for testing and validating robotic behaviors\\n* **NVIDIA Isaac**: High-fidelity, GPU-accelerated simulation and AI integration\\n* **Unity**: Advanced visualization, rendering, and digital twin development\\n* **OpenAI Whisper**: Speech-to-action functionality for Vision-Language-Action pipelines\\n* **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Cognitive reasoning, task planning, and natural-language interaction\\n\\n## Personal Interests\\n\\nBeyond robotics and AI, I\u2019m deeply interested in the intersection of technology and education. I believe real impact comes from making advanced systems understandable, approachable, and useful for a wider audience.\\n\\nI enjoy designing learning experiences that balance strong theoretical foundations with hands-on implementation. When not actively working on projects, I stay engaged with the latest AI research and continuously explore better ways to explain complex technical ideas.\\n\\nThe AI-Native Textbook reflects my long-term commitment to advancing robotics education and empowering the next generation of roboticists with the knowledge, tools, and mindset needed to shape the future of intelligent machines."}]}}')}}]);
