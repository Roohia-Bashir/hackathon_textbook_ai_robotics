<p>I’m roohia-bashir, an AI and robotics enthusiast dedicated to building clear, practical, and future-focused educational resources in the domain of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. My work emphasizes translating complex AI ideas into real-world robotic systems that learners can understand and apply.</p>
<p>My expertise covers multiple areas, including:</p>
<p>* Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
* Robotics frameworks, with a strong focus on ROS 2
* Simulation platforms such as Gazebo and NVIDIA Isaac
* Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems
* Educational technology and curriculum development</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="motivation-for-creating-the-ai-native-textbook">Motivation for Creating the AI-Native Textbook<a href="https://roohia-bashir.github.io/hackathon_textbook_ai_robotics/blog/2025/12/10/about-muhammad-waheed#motivation-for-creating-the-ai-native-textbook" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Motivation for Creating the AI-Native Textbook" title="Direct link to Motivation for Creating the AI-Native Textbook" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>The motivation behind the AI-Native Textbook for Physical AI &amp; Humanoid Robotics came from observing a major gap in existing robotics education. Many traditional programs do not sufficiently integrate modern AI techniques with physical robotic systems, particularly for humanoid robotics.</p>
<p>This textbook was created to:</p>
<p>* Offer a structured 13-week curriculum covering both foundational and advanced robotics topics
* Integrate state-of-the-art AI models with real and simulated robotic platforms
* Make complex robotics concepts accessible to students, developers, and educators
* Cover the full robotics pipeline, from sensing and perception to planning and autonomy
* Use industry-standard tools and workflows commonly adopted in professional environments</p>
<p>The overarching goal is to democratize access to high-quality robotics education and help learners prepare for the future of AI-powered physical systems.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="technologies-used-in-this-project">Technologies Used in This Project<a href="https://roohia-bashir.github.io/hackathon_textbook_ai_robotics/blog/2025/12/10/about-muhammad-waheed#technologies-used-in-this-project" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Technologies Used in This Project" title="Direct link to Technologies Used in This Project" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>The AI-Native Textbook is built using a modern and carefully selected technology stack:</p>
<p>* <strong>ROS 2 (Robot Operating System)</strong>: The primary middleware for robot communication, control, and navigation
* <strong>Docusaurus</strong>: The documentation framework used to deliver structured and readable technical content
* <strong>Node.js</strong>: Supporting the build pipeline and static site generation
* <strong>Gazebo</strong>: Physics-based simulation for testing and validating robotic behaviors
* <strong>NVIDIA Isaac</strong>: High-fidelity, GPU-accelerated simulation and AI integration
* <strong>Unity</strong>: Advanced visualization, rendering, and digital twin development
* <strong>OpenAI Whisper</strong>: Speech-to-action functionality for Vision-Language-Action pipelines
* <strong>Large Language Models (LLMs)</strong>: Cognitive reasoning, task planning, and natural-language interaction</p>

<p>Beyond robotics and AI, I’m deeply interested in the intersection of technology and education. I believe real impact comes from making advanced systems understandable, approachable, and useful for a wider audience.</p>
<p>I enjoy designing learning experiences that balance strong theoretical foundations with hands-on implementation. When not actively working on projects, I stay engaged with the latest AI research and continuously explore better ways to explain complex technical ideas.</p>
<p>The AI-Native Textbook reflects my long-term commitment to advancing robotics education and empowering the next generation of roboticists with the knowledge, tools, and mindset needed to shape the future of intelligent machines.</p>]]></content>
