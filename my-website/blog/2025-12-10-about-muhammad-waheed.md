# About the Author: roohia-bashir

## Professional Background & Expertise

I’m roohia-bashir, an AI and robotics enthusiast dedicated to building clear, practical, and future-focused educational resources in the domain of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. My work emphasizes translating complex AI ideas into real-world robotic systems that learners can understand and apply.

My expertise covers multiple areas, including:

* Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
* Robotics frameworks, with a strong focus on ROS 2
* Simulation platforms such as Gazebo and NVIDIA Isaac
* Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems
* Educational technology and curriculum development

## Motivation for Creating the AI-Native Textbook

The motivation behind the AI-Native Textbook for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics came from observing a major gap in existing robotics education. Many traditional programs do not sufficiently integrate modern AI techniques with physical robotic systems, particularly for humanoid robotics.

This textbook was created to:

* Offer a structured 13-week curriculum covering both foundational and advanced robotics topics
* Integrate state-of-the-art AI models with real and simulated robotic platforms
* Make complex robotics concepts accessible to students, developers, and educators
* Cover the full robotics pipeline, from sensing and perception to planning and autonomy
* Use industry-standard tools and workflows commonly adopted in professional environments

The overarching goal is to democratize access to high-quality robotics education and help learners prepare for the future of AI-powered physical systems.

## Technologies Used in This Project

The AI-Native Textbook is built using a modern and carefully selected technology stack:

* **ROS 2 (Robot Operating System)**: The primary middleware for robot communication, control, and navigation
* **Docusaurus**: The documentation framework used to deliver structured and readable technical content
* **Node.js**: Supporting the build pipeline and static site generation
* **Gazebo**: Physics-based simulation for testing and validating robotic behaviors
* **NVIDIA Isaac**: High-fidelity, GPU-accelerated simulation and AI integration
* **Unity**: Advanced visualization, rendering, and digital twin development
* **OpenAI Whisper**: Speech-to-action functionality for Vision-Language-Action pipelines
* **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Cognitive reasoning, task planning, and natural-language interaction

## Personal Interests

Beyond robotics and AI, I’m deeply interested in the intersection of technology and education. I believe real impact comes from making advanced systems understandable, approachable, and useful for a wider audience.

I enjoy designing learning experiences that balance strong theoretical foundations with hands-on implementation. When not actively working on projects, I stay engaged with the latest AI research and continuously explore better ways to explain complex technical ideas.

The AI-Native Textbook reflects my long-term commitment to advancing robotics education and empowering the next generation of roboticists with the knowledge, tools, and mindset needed to shape the future of intelligent machines.
